# AAE5303 Environment Setup Report — Template for Students

> **Important:** Follow this structure exactly in your submission README.  
> Your goal is to demonstrate **evidence, process, problem-solving, and reflection** — not only screenshots.

## 2. Python Environment Check

### 2.1 Steps Taken

Describe briefly how you created/activated your Python environment:

**Tool used:**  
_[venv]_

**Key commands you ran:**
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Any deviations from the default instructions:**

```markdown
### Issue 1: requirements.txt not found

Problem:
pip install -r requirements.txt failed because the file does not exist.

Cause:
The repository only contains a README.md file and does not provide a
requirements.txt file.

Solution:
Instead of installing dependencies, the Python environment was verified by
checking Python and pip versions directly.

Verification:
Python virtual environment was activated successfully and version checks passed.


### 2.2 Test Results

Run these commands and paste the actual terminal output (not just screenshots):

```bash
python scripts/test_python_env.py
```

**Output:**
```
[Paste your actual terminal output here]
```

```bash
python scripts/test_open3d_pointcloud.py
```

**Output:**
```
[Paste your actual terminal output here]
```

**Screenshot:**  
_[Include one screenshot showing both tests passing]_

## 3. ROS 2 Workspace Check

### 3.1 Build the workspace

Paste the build output summary (final lines only):

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
colcon build
```

**Expected output:**
```
Summary: 1 package finished [x.xx s]
```

**Your actual output:**
```
[Paste your build summary here]
```

### 3.2 Run talker and listener

Show both source commands:

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
```

**Then run talker:**
```bash
ros2 run env_check_pkg talker.py
```

**Output (3–4 lines):**
```
[Paste 3-4 lines of talker output here]
```

**Run listener:**
```bash
ros2 run env_check_pkg listener.py
```

**Output (3–4 lines):**
```
[Paste 3-4 lines of listener output here]
```

**Alternative (using launch file):**
```bash
ros2 launch env_check_pkg env_check.launch.py
```

**Screenshot:**  
_[Include one screenshot showing talker + listener running]_

## 4. Problems Encountered and How I Solved Them

> **Note:** Write 2–3 issues, even if small. This section is crucial — it demonstrates understanding and problem-solving.

### Issue 1: [Write the exact error message or problem]

**Cause / diagnosis:**  
_[Explain what you think caused it]_

**Fix:**  
_[The exact command/config change you used to solve it]_

```bash
[Your fix command/code here]
```

**Reference:**  
_[Official ROS docs? StackOverflow? AI assistant? Something else?]_

---

### Issue 2: [Another real error or roadblock]

**Cause / diagnosis:**  
_[Explain what you think caused it]_

**Fix:**  
_[The exact command/config change you used to solve it]_

```bash
[Your fix command/code here]
```

**Reference:**  
_[Official ROS docs? StackOverflow? AI assistant? Something else?]_

---

### Issue 3 (Optional): [Title]

**Cause / diagnosis:**  
_[Explain what you think caused it]_

**Fix:**  
_[The exact command/config change you used to solve it]_

```bash
[Your fix command/code here]
```

**Reference:**  
_[Official ROS docs? StackOverflow? AI assistant? Something else?]_

## 5. Use of Generative AI (Required)

Choose one of the issues above and document how you used AI to solve it.

> **Goal:** Show critical use of AI, not blind copying.

### 5.1 Exact prompt you asked

**Your prompt:**
```
[Copy-paste your actual message to the AI, not a summary]
```

### 5.2 Key helpful part of the AI's answer

**AI's response (relevant part only):**
```
[Quote only the relevant part of the AI's answer]
```

### 5.3 What you changed or ignored and why

Explain briefly:
- Did the AI recommend something unsafe?
- Did you modify its solution?
- Did you double-check with official docs?

**Your explanation:**  
_[Write your analysis here]_

### 5.4 Final solution you applied

Show the exact command or file edit that fixed the problem:

```bash
[Your final command/code here]
```

**Why this worked:**  
_[Brief explanation]_

## 6. Reflection (3–5 sentences)

Short but thoughtful:

- What did you learn about configuring robotics environments?
- What surprised you?
- What would you do differently next time (backup, partitioning, reading error logs, asking better AI questions)?
- How confident do you feel about debugging ROS/Python issues now?

**Your reflection:**

_[Write your 3-5 sentence reflection here]_

## 7. Declaration

✅ **I confirm that I performed this setup myself and all screenshots/logs reflect my own environment.**

**Name:**  
_[Your name]_

**Student ID:**  
_[Your student ID]_

**Date:**  
_[Date of submission]_

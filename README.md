## 2. Python Environment Check

### 2.1 Steps Taken

Describe briefly how you created/activated your Python environment:

**Tool used:**  
_[venv]_

**Key commands you ran:**
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Any deviations from the default instructions:**  

The repository does not provide a requirements.txt file.
Problem:
pip install -r requirements.txt failed because the file does not exist.

Cause:
The repository only contains a README.md file and does not include a
requirements.txt file for dependency installation.

Solution:
Instead of installing dependencies, the Python environment was verified by
checking Python and pip versions directly.

Verification:
The virtual environment activated successfully and Python version checks passed.

### 2.2 Test Results

Run these commands and paste the actual terminal output (not just screenshots):

```bash
python scripts/test_python_env.py
```

**Output:**
```

========================================
AAE5303 Environment Check (Python + ROS)
Goal: help you verify your environment and understand what each check means.
========================================

Step 1: Environment snapshot
  Why: We capture platform/Python/ROS variables to diagnose common setup mistakes (especially mixed ROS env).
Step 2: Python version
  Why: The course assumes Python 3.10+; older versions often break package wheels.
Step 3: Python imports (required/optional)
  Why: Imports verify packages are installed and compatible with your Python version.
Step 4: NumPy sanity checks
  Why: We run a small linear algebra operation so success means more than just `import numpy`.
Step 5: SciPy sanity checks
  Why: We run a small FFT to confirm SciPy is functional (not just installed).
Step 6: Matplotlib backend check
  Why: We generate a tiny plot image (headless) to confirm plotting works on your system.
Step 7: OpenCV PNG decoding (subprocess)
  Why: PNG decoding uses native code; we isolate it so corruption/codec issues cannot crash the whole report.
Step 8: Open3D basic geometry + I/O (subprocess)
  Why: Open3D is a native extension; ABI mismatches can segfault. Subprocess isolation turns crashes into readable failures.
Step 9: ROS toolchain checks
  Why: The course requires ROS tooling. This check passes if ROS 2 OR ROS 1 is available (either one is acceptable).
Step 10: Basic CLI availability
  Why: We confirm core commands exist on PATH so students can run the same commands as in the labs.

## 3. ROS 2 Workspace Check

### 3.1 Build the workspace

Paste the build output summary (final lines only):

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
colcon build
```

**Expected output:**
```
Summary: 1 package finished [x.xx s]
```

**Your actual output:**
```
[Starting >>> env_check_pkg
Finished <<< env_check_pkg [0.18s]

Summary: 1 package finished [0.49s]]
```

### 3.2 Run talker and listener

Show both source commands:

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
```

**Then run talker:**
```bash
ros2 run env_check_pkg talker.py
```

**Output (3–4 lines):**
```
[Paste 3-4 lines of talker output here]
```

**Run listener:**
```bash
ros2 run env_check_pkg listener.py
```

**Output (3–4 lines):**
```
[Paste 3-4 lines of listener output here]
```

**Alternative (using launch file):**
```bash
ros2 launch env_check_pkg env_check.launch.py
```

**Screenshot:**

## 4. Problems Encountered and How I Solved Them

> **Note:** Write 2–3 issues, even if small. This section is crucial — it demonstrates understanding and problem-solving.

### Issue 1: [ROS requirement not satisfied during Python environment test.]

**Cause / diagnosis:**  
_[The Python test script was executed inside a virtual environment without
sourcing the ROS 2 setup file. Therefore, ROS-related commands were not
available in that terminal session.]_

**Fix:**  
_[Opened a new terminal and manually sourced the ROS 2 environment before running
any ROS-related commands.]_

```bash
[source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash]
```

**Reference:**  
_[Terminal output, official ROS 2 documentation, and AI assistant]_

---

### Issue 2: [Another real error or roadblock]

**Cause / diagnosis:**  
_[Explain what you think caused it]_

**Fix:**  
_[The exact command/config change you used to solve it]_

```bash
[Your fix command/code here]
```

**Reference:**  
_[Official ROS docs? StackOverflow? AI assistant? Something else?]_

---

### Issue 3 (Optional): [Title]

**Cause / diagnosis:**  
_[Explain what you think caused it]_

**Fix:**  
_[The exact command/config change you used to solve it]_

```bash
[Your fix command/code here]
```

**Reference:**  
_[Official ROS docs? StackOverflow? AI assistant? Something else?]_

## 5. Use of Generative AI (Required)

Choose one of the issues above and document how you used AI to solve it.

> **Goal:** Show critical use of AI, not blind copying.

### 5.1 Exact prompt you asked

**Your prompt:**
```
[Copy-paste your actual message to the AI, not a summary]
```

### 5.2 Key helpful part of the AI's answer

**AI's response (relevant part only):**
```
[Quote only the relevant part of the AI's answer]
```

### 5.3 What you changed or ignored and why

Explain briefly:
- Did the AI recommend something unsafe?
- Did you modify its solution?
- Did you double-check with official docs?

**Your explanation:**  
_[Write your analysis here]_

### 5.4 Final solution you applied

Show the exact command or file edit that fixed the problem:

```bash
[Your final command/code here]
```

**Why this worked:**  
_[Brief explanation]_

## 6. Reflection (3–5 sentences)

Short but thoughtful:

- What did you learn about configuring robotics environments?
- What surprised you?
- What would you do differently next time (backup, partitioning, reading error logs, asking better AI questions)?
- How confident do you feel about debugging ROS/Python issues now?

**Your reflection:**
